# MBDF
Python script for generating the local/global Many Body Distribution Functionals (MBDF) and Density of Functionals (DF) representations.
It also contains functions for generating the Coulomb Matrix (CM) and Bag of Bonds (BOB) representations.

Note : The first functional from the paper has been split into two parts.

# Dependencies
Python libraries required : 
* Numpy
* Numba
* Joblib

If a progress bar is desired during the representation generation then the `tqdm` library is also required.

# Usage
* To generate the **local** MBDF representation for your entire dataset:
```
from MBDF import generate_mbdf
rep_local = generate_mbdf(charges, coordinates)
```
* To generate a flattened, bagged form which can be used as a global feature vector:
```
from MBDF import generate_mbdf
rep_flattened = generate_mbdf(charges, coordinates, local = False)
```

Where `charges` is an array containing lists (or arrays) of nuclear charges for all molecules in the dataset. Likewise, `coordinates` should be an array containing lists (or arrays) of atomic coordinates for all molecules. 

Note : The atomic coordinates should be provided in Angstrom.

The `cutoff_r` keyword controls the local radial cutoff distance for all functionals. The default value is 8 Ã….

The `n_jobs` parameter controls the number of cores over which the representation generation will be parallelized. Default value is `-1` which means all cores in the system will be used.

`progress_bar = True` can be used to obtain a progress bar during the representation generation process. This requires the `tqdm` library.

It is recommended that the MBDF arrays be generated for the entire dataset (train & test) together since the functional values are normalized w.r.t their maximum in the dataset. This makes hyperparameter selection (length scales) easier when using Kernel based methods. The normalization can be turned off using `normalized = False`



* To generate the Density of functionals representation the MBDF array is required :
```
from MBDF import generate_mbdf, generate_df
mbdf = generate_mbdf(charges, coordinates)
df = generate_df(mbdf, charges)
```
Where `mbdf` is the array containing the MBDF representation for all molecules in the dataset and `charges` is an array containing lists (or arrays) of nuclear charges for all molecules in the dataset.

The `binsize` keyword controls the grid-spacing used for discretizing the density function. The default value is 0.2 but this can be lowered if a higher resolution is required. It makes the representation perform better but increases its size.

The `bw` keyword controls the bandwidth hyperparameter of the representation. The default value is 0.07 but this should be screened once in the range `[0.01,1]` for new datasets and when changing the grid-spacing using the `binsize` parameter.

# Kernels and wrapper
* For MBDF it is recommended to use the `get_local_symmetric_kernel_mbdf` and `get_local_kernel_mbdf` available at the qmlcode fork : https://github.com/dkhan42/qml2/tree/develop
* Wrappers for training KRR models using qmlcode and examples for using these scripts are available at : https://github.com/dkhan42/QMLwrap
